# b.plot library

As my art research is going even further, I require beautifull plots that doesn't exist, so i'm creating my own.
The main goal is to develop a fully usable library.

## Work in progress  
   
So far I'm just prototyping the main functions, and I already have the result I want, the next step is to build even more plots dedicated to color study.
